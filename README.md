# Tracking Energy Transition: Global Trends and Regional Leadership

This repository contains the code and data for the first part of our analysis of global energy transitions. In this section, we use computational text analysis and corpus linguistics methods to examine the evolving concept of 'energy transition' over time, focusing on COP conference reports from 1995 to 2024. The second part of the analysis is qualitative and explores the energy transition in Brazil and Chile by analyzing their energy infrastructure and policies to understand their leadership in Latin America's shift toward non- and low-carbon energy sources.

The key research questions addressed in this project are:

## How has the concept of 'energy transition' been translated into policy measures over time?
## What factors have positioned Brazil and Chile as regional leaders in the energy transition?
